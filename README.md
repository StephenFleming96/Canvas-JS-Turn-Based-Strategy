# Canvas & JS: Turn-Based-Strategy
Strategy game made using HTML Canvas and plain Javascript. 
No frameworks or libraries.

Created for Gynvael's Winter GameDev Challenge 2017.

## How to Play
The player starts with 3 units and has a total of 5 moves per turn between them.

The player can only see the enemy units in the same room(s) that his\her units are located in, 
so you must move your units around and search for the targets.

**Mouse Hovering** over a room will highlight its tiles.

**Left Click** on a unit (blue circle) to select that unit.


### When a unit is selected:

**Left Click** to deselect the unit

**Right Click** on a blue tile to move in that direction

**Right Click** on an enemy unit (red circle) to attack it.

## Requirements
Uses some ES6 features, so there may be issues with older browsers.
